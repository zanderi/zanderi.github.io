# Feature Driven Development
Feature Driven Development (FDD) is an agile software development methodology that focuses on delivering tangible, working software features on a regular and predictable schedule. FDD emphasizes the use of modeling and planning techniques to help teams break down complex software projects into manageable parts and to track progress throughout the development process.

## FDD consists of five main phases:

**Develop an overall model**: In this phase, the team creates an overall model of the system they are developing, identifying the main features and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks.

**Build a feature list**: The team creates a feature list based on the overall model, prioritizing the features and identifying dependencies between them.

**Plan by feature**: The team creates detailed plans for each feature, including estimates for the time and resources needed to complete each one.

**Design by feature**: The team designs and develops each feature, using test-driven development and other techniques to ensure that each feature meets the requirements and is of high quality.

**Build by feature**: The team builds and integrates each feature into the larger system, testing and verifying the functionality at each step.

Throughout the development process, FDD emphasizes frequent communication, collaboration, and feedback among team members, stakeholders, and customers. The methodology also emphasizes the use of metrics and tracking tools to monitor progress, identify potential issues, and make adjustments as needed.
